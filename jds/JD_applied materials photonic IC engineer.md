# Photonic IC Design Engineer

The Photonic IC Design Engineer is responsible for the design of high-speed photonic ICs; for the system design of the optical integrated products of the connectivity solutions for Applied Materials. It is a senior engineer that initiates initial blueprints of the products & solutions and is pulling the different engineering practices together to form a great engineering team.

This role is also supporting Product Marketing with the Product Roadmap. The Photonic IC Design Engineer is a trusted partner of the customers. This role will get insights about product performance and needs and will develop and implement concepts for a wide range of significantly complex product issues and engineering solutions.

Responsible for the engineering of various photonic ICs (PICs) from initiation to general availability including the design and characterization of the product.
Assure design for performance, manufacturability, and cost.
Select components (analog and digital EICs, various optical) for high speed architectures.
Create schematics and layout circuits.
Work with test and firmware engineering in the development of PICs
Work with foundries to co-design and fabricate PICs
Carry on Design Verification Tests (DVT). Write technical reports.
Functional Knowledge

Experience with various active and passive component design
